# Medal Palindrome React Project

Medal React Code project using my development environment/boilerplate. Includes deploying with
netlify, linting/formatting, and documentation generation. Built using Gatsby.

## Assumptions

The prompt shows that the `oo` in `pool` should be correct, but the `civic` in `civics` is not
correct. The criteria for correct characters seems inconsistent as they are palindromic substrings.
Therefore I use the [Manacher's
Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_palindromic_substring) to determine the largest
correct palindromic substring and mark that substring as correct.
